# Changes for version 1.0

1. Code related to "smoothing" is removed.
   The implemented "EKF smoother" is a half-baked approach which doesn't correspond to a well define optimal algorithm.
   I've decided to remove it to reduce the amount of code to take care of.
2. Filter classes were replaced by more straightforward plain functions.
3. All data is now indexed by time in seconds, not IMU stamp.
   This is a more intuitive and convenient approach which directly corresponds to practical algorithms.
   This also allows to more optimally process measurements not precisely synchronous with IMU samples, which again
   corresponds to real-world data.
4. All data now is stored in pandas DataFrame with consistent column naming
5. Cython was replaced by numba to avoid the need of compilation
6. HTML documentation and examples are reworked and cleaned up
